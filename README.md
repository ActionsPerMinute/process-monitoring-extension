# AppDynamics Processes Monitoring Extension


##Use Case

The AppDynamics Process extension observes active processes on a Linux or Windows machine and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

The Processes extension retrieves the following metrics of each process:

-   CPU utilization in %
-   Memory utilization in MB
-   Memory utilization in %
-   Number of running instances. (If there are, for example, 3 Java processes running, this monitor will summarize them to one single report)

XML files:

-   monitor.xml: This is used to execute the Java code which starts
    the extension.
-   properties.xml: This file enables you to filter out
    which metrics are going to be reported and displayed on the metric
    browser.

##Files

Files/Folders Included:

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<th align = 'left'> Directory/File </th>
<th align = 'left'> Description </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> conf </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Contains the monitor.xml and properties.xml </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> lib </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Contains third-party project references </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> src </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Contains source code to the Process Monitoring Extension </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> dist </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Only obtained when using ant. Run 'ant build' to get binaries. Run 'ant package' to get the distributable .zip file </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> build.xml </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Ant build script to package the project (required only if changing Java code) </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

##Installation

1. Run 'ant package' from the process-monitoring-extension directory
2. Download the file ProcessMonitor.zip located in the 'dist' directory into \<machineagent install dir\>/monitors/
3. Unzip the downloaded file
4. In \<machineagent install dir\>/monitors/ProcessMonitor/, open monitor.xml and configure the path to the properties.xml.
5. Optional but recommended. Configure a custom metric path (in monitor.xml).
6. Optional. Open properties.xml and configure the filter values.
7. Restart the Machine Agent.

In the AppDynamics Metric Browser, look for: Application Infrastructure Performance  | \<Tier\> | Custom Metrics | \<Windows/Linux\>Â Processes
or your specified path under Application Infrastructure Performance  | \<Tier\> |.

![](images/emoticons/information.gif) If you are running Windows,  make sure that the file 'csv.xsl' is in 'C:\Windows\System32' for 32bit or 'C:\Windows\SysWOW64' for 64bit OS versions (standard under Windows Server 2003).
If this file is not found, the process monitor will output an error to the log file (logs/machine-agent.log) .

##XML Examples

###monitor.xml

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
| properties\_path | Location of the properties.xml |
| metric\_path | Configuring this will limit the report of the metrics to one single tier |

##Metrics

###For each process the monitor is reporting for:


<table><tbody>
<tr>
<th align = 'left'> Metric Name </th>
<th align = 'left'> Description </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> CPU utilization in Percent </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Memory Utilization Absolute (MB) </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Memory Utilization in Percent </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Number of running instances </td>
<td class='confluenceTd'> Often there are multiple processes running under the same name, and this is their count. </td>
</tr>
