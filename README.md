# AppDynamics Processes - Monitoring Extension

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent.

##Use Case
The AppDynamics Process extension observes active processes on a Linux or Windows machine and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

The Processes extension retrieves the following metrics of each process:

-   CPU utilization in %
-   Memory utilization in MB
-   Memory utilization in %
-   Number of running instances. (If there are, for example, 3 Java processes running, this monitor will report them individually)


##Installation
1. Run 'mvn clean install' from the process-monitoring-extension directory and find the ProcessMonitor.zip in the "target" folder.
2. Unzip as "ProcessMonitor" and copy the "ProcessMonitor" directory to `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors`
3. In `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors/ProcessMonitor/`, open monitor.xml and configure the path to the properties.xml and monitored-processes.
4. Optional but recommended. Configure a custom metric path (in monitor.xml).
5. Optional. Open properties.xml and configure the filter values. NOTE: If the memory threshold is not specified in properties.xml, then a default value of 100MB will be used by the extension. This means that any processes below this threshold will not appear in the Metric Browser.
6. Restart the Machine Agent.

In the AppDynamics Metric Browser, look for: Application Infrastructure Performance  | \<Tier\> | Custom Metrics | \<Windows/Linux\>Â Processes
or your specified path under Application Infrastructure Performance  | \<Tier\> |.

NOTE: If there are multiple processes with the same name (i.e. 3 "java.exe" processes), they will be identified by their PID in the Metric Browser.

###XML files to modify
<ul>
<li>monitor.xml: This is used to execute the Java code which starts the extension. You might need to configure the path to the other xml file (see <a href="http://docs.appdynamics.com/display/ACE/Processes?sortBy=name#Processes-monitor.xml" target="_blank">monitor.xml</a> (requires login)).</li>
<li>properties.xml: This file enables you to filter out which metrics are going to be reported and displayed on the metric browser (see <a href="http://docs.appdynamics.com/display/ACE/Processes?sortBy=name#Processes-properties.xml" target="_blank">properties.xml</a> (requires login)).</li>
</ul>

**Note**: If you are running Windows,  make sure that the file 'csv.xsl' is in 'C:\Windows\System32' for 32bit or 'C:\Windows\SysWOW64' for 64bit OS versions (standard under Windows Server 2003).
If this file is not found, the process monitor will output an error to the log file (logs/machine-agent.log) .
